NAME
    INSTALL - installation instructions for WordNet-SenseRelate-WordToSet

SYNOPSIS
        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test
        make install

DESCRIPTION
  Dependencies
    Two modules are required by WordNet::SenseRelate::WordToSet:

        WordNet::QueryData
        WordNet::Similarity

    Both modules are available from CPAN (<http://search.cpan.org>).

  Detailed instructions
    Before installing this library, the dependencies listed above must be
    resolved.

    If you have superuser/root access, you should be able to install
    WordNet::SenseRelate::WordToSet by following these simple steps:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make test # optional, but recommended
        su        # or use sudo, if applicable
        make install

    If you need to install this distribution in your local user account
    because you lack superuser privileges, then the recommended method on
    Unix-like systems is as follows:

        perl Makfile.PL PREFIX=~/senserelate LIB=~/lib
        make
        make test
        make install

    This will install the executable scripts into ~/senserelate/bin, the man
    pages in ~/senserelate/man, and the libraries into ~/lib. you will need
    to set your PERL5LIB variable to point to the LIB directory.

    In bash:

        export PERL5LIB=~/lib

    In csh or tcsh:

        setenv PERL5LIB ~/lib

    Add these lines to your .bashrc, .bash_profile, or .cshrc files as the
    case may be.
