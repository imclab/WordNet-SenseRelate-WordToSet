NAME
    WordNet-SenseRelate-WordToSet version 0.03

OVERVIEW
    This module takes as input a single target word, and a set of one or
    more other words. It finds the sense of that target word that is most
    related to those words in the set. For example, if the target word is
    "bank", and the words in the set are "money cash loan stock", we might
    expect that the most related sense of "bank" is that pertaining to
    financial instituations.

    This is potentially useful in determining the predominant sense of a
    word in a particular domain. For example, if the target word is "game",
    and the words in the set are from the domain of board games (e.g.,
    "monopoly chess checkers", then the sense of "game" that we'd expect to
    be most similar or related would be that of games you play rather than
    the game you hunt. For example, here's some output for this case:

     wordtoset.pl game monopoly checkers chess --type WordNet::Similarity::wup

     game#n#1 : 2.52631578947368 : a contest with rules to determine a winner; "you need four people to play this game"  

     game#n#10 : 2.17777777777778 : your occupation or line of work; "he's in the plumbing game"; "she's in show biz"  

     game#n#3 : 2.17777777777778 : an amusement or pastime; "they played word games"; "he thought of his painting as a game that filled his empty time"; "his life was all fun and games"  

     ------------------------

     wordtoset.pl game turkey boar deer --type WordNet::Similarity::wup

     game#n#4 : 1.98 : animal hunted for food or sport  

     game#n#7 : 1.27777777777778 : the flesh of wild animals that is used for food  

     game#n#9 : 1.24542124542125 : the game equipment needed in order to play a particular game; "the child received several games for his birthday"  

    Note that wordtoset.pl will output all of the senses, but we've only
    shown the top three here in the interests of brevity. We can see that
    according to the Wu-Palmer measure (wup), the sense of game most similar
    to the given sense is as we've described above.

    WordToSet might also be useful in detecting sentiment orientation. For
    example, suppose the target word is "war". You could compare that to two
    different sets such as : "peace love happiness" and "hate death fear".
    While the predominant sense of "war" might not change, if it has a
    substantially higher score relative to one of the sets then it could be
    concluded that war is more associated with that set than the other.

    This module uses WordNet and measures of semantic relatedness and
    similarity from WordNet::Similarity to arrive at its output.

       # from within a program

       use WordNet::SenseRelate::WordToSet;
       use WordNet::QueryData;

       my $qd = WordNet::QueryData->new;

       my %options = (wordnet => $qd,
                      measure => 'WordNet::Similarity::lesk');

       my $wsd = WordNet::SenseRelate::WordToSet->new (%options);

       my $result = $wsd->disambiguate (target => 'java',
                          context => ['programming_language', 'applet']);

       foreach my $key (keys %$result) {
           print $key, ' : ', $result->{$key}, "\n";
       }

CONTENTS
    When the distribution is unpacked, several subdirectories are created:

    /lib
        This directory contains the Perl modules that do the actual work of
        disambiguation. By default, these files are isntalled into
        /usr/local/lib/site_perl/PERL_VERSION (where PERL_VERSION is the
        version of Perl you are using), or a similar directory. See the
        INSTALL file for more details.

    /bin
        This directory contains a script, wordtoset.pl, that lets you run
        the WSD software without writing your own Perl script.

    /doc
        This directory contains pod files for README, CHANGES, and INSTALL.
        These are what should be changed, the files found in the top level
        directory should be considered read-only.

    /t  This directory contains test scripts. These scripts are run when you
        run 'make test'.
